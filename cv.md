### Briefly About Myself:
At the beginning of my acquaintance with the field of IT, and to be more precise, front-end development, I began to study HTML and CSS. I started building one page websites.

Initially, I didn’t quite succeed, but over time things went uphill. I started to like this type of activity and I decided to go further and started studying JS, where it is not clear you have to search for information on the Internet, which I think you also need to be able to do, because the ability to correctly find and select the right information is one of the most important qualities. I also know how to work in a team and know how to listen to people.

In general, I would like to continue to develop in this area and become a cool specialist.
