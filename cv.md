### Briefly About Myself:
At the beginning of my acquaintance with the field of IT, and to be more precise, front-end development, I began to study HTML and CSS. I started building one page websites.

Initially, I didn’t quite succeed, but over time things went uphill. I started to like this type of activity and I decided to go further and started studying JavaScript, where it is not clear you have to search for information on the Internet, which I think you also need to be able to do, because the ability to correctly find and select the right information is one of the most important qualities. I also know how to work in a team and know how to listen to people.

In general, I would like to continue to develop in this area and become a cool specialist.

### Code example:
Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first n multiples of x.
Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.
Return the results as an array or list ( depending on language ).

```
function countBy(x, n) {
    let z = [];
    for (let i = 1; i > 0; i++) {
        if (i % x == 0 ) {
            z.push(i)
        } 
        if (z.length == n) {
            return z;
        }
    }
}

console.log(countBy(3, 10))
```
